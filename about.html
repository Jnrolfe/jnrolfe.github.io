        <p class="card-text text-justify">I was raised in Topeka, Kansas with a dad who farmed for most
        of his life. As a result, I had a forced appreciation for fixing anything and everything. Eventually, this appreciation lead me to tinker with video games and computers; however, I originally enjoyed fixing cars more than anything. <br><br>
         
         After high school I went to the University of Kansas, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. This only lasted a semester
         after which I changed my major to Computer Engineering which I found to be more aligned with my
         current interests. For my junior year I studied abroad to the University of Hong Kong in Hong Kong, China.
         My semester abroad was amazing and opened my eyes to AI and its applications. Unfortunately, the
         semester abroad also caused me to miss some pre-requisite classes and extended my undergraduate to 5 years, but also allowed me
         to add a Mathematics major. <br><br>

         Directly after my undergraduate, I enrolled at Brown University for a Master's of Science in
         Computer Science concentrating in Systems. I will be graduating from Brown University in May 2020.

        <h5 class="card-title">My Interests</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-justify">I enjoy anything systems-related, especially if it's
        architecting a new system to fit in with legacy systems. I like to be involved from the conception
        all the way to the deployment of new systems. <br><br>

        In my free time I enjoy building robots (mostly smart RC cars or drones) or anything that goes
        fast and needs smart fault-tolerance.
